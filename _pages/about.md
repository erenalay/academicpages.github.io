**“You cannot take what you have not given, and you must give yourself. You cannot buy the Revolution. You cannot make the Revolution. 
You can only be the Revolution.”**

## About me

I received my B.S. degree in [Electronics Engineering](http://eee.ankara.edu.tr/) 
from [Ankara University](https://en.ankara.edu.tr/), Ankara, Turkey in 2011 and 
my M.S. degree in [Biomedical Engineering](https://biomedical.njit.edu/) from 
[New Jersey Institute of Technology (NJIT)](https://www.njit.edu/), Newark, NJ 
in 2014. I was a research assistant working with Prof. Mesut Sahin in Neural Prosthetics Lab. 
Later on, I joined the Center for Injury Biomechanics, Materials and Medicine as 
research associate on December 2014.

Previously, I performed research with Profs. Chandra and Skotak while working as 
a research associate at the [Center for Injury Biomechanics, Materials and Medicine](https://centers.njit.edu/cibm3/) 
at NJIT. I performed research that rely on the investigation of the characteristics 
and the effects of blast waves on both animal and biomechanical models. This includes 
evaluation of biomechanical loading via pressure measurements, investigation of 
biochemical changes in the injured brains and computational work. The biggest part 
of my workload comprises analysis and interpretation of the experimental 
data, i.e. quantification of characteristics of various pressure-time waveforms, 
including time-series analysis, evaluation of histological samples from high-resolution 
imaging of full coronal brain sections (e.g. silver stain and various immunohistochemical stains).

In August, I will be working with [Samantha Kleinberg](http://www.skleinberg.org/) 
as a PhD student in [Health and AI Lab](http://www.healthailab.org/) at 
[Stevens](https://www.stevens.edu/schaefer-school-engineering-science/departments/computer-science). 

I am interested in research problems based on: 
		
   1) information extraction and integration from multiscale, multimodal health informatics, 
	 2) learning from the health data,
	 3)causal inference. 
			
My ultimate goal is to push the frontiers of knowledge in research areas such as 
personalized medicine, predictive diagnostics, and decision making by the power of 
artificial intelligence, machine learning and deep learning.
