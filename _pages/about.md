**“You cannot take what you have not given, and you must give yourself. You cannot buy the Revolution. You cannot make the Revolution. 
You can only be the Revolution.”**

## About me

I received my B.S. degree in [Electronics Engineering](http://eee.ankara.edu.tr/) 
from [Ankara University](https://en.ankara.edu.tr/), Ankara, Turkey in 2011 and 
my M.S. degree in [Biomedical Engineering](https://biomedical.njit.edu/) from 
[New Jersey Institute of Technology (NJIT)](https://www.njit.edu/), Newark, NJ 
in 2014. I was a research assistant working with [Prof. Mesut Sahin](https://biomedical.njit.edu/faculty/sahin) 
in [Neural Prosthetics Lab](https://web.njit.edu/~sahin/). 
In December 2014, I joined [Center for Injury Biomechanics, Materials and Medicine](https://centers.njit.edu/cibm3/) 
at NJIT as research associate performing research with Profs. Chandra and Skotak. 
I worked on research projects that rely on the investigation of the characteristics 
and the effects of blast waves on both animal and biomechanical models. This includes
evaluation of biomechanical loading via pressure measurements, investigation of 
biochemical changes in the injured brains and computational work. The biggest part 
of my workload comprised analysis and interpretation of the experimental data, 
i.e. quantification of characteristics of various pressure-time waveforms, including 
time-series analysis, evaluation of histological samples from high-resolution imaging 
of full coronal brain sections (e.g. silver stain and various immunohistochemical stains).

Currently, I am working with [Prof. Samantha Kleinberg](http://www.skleinberg.org/) 
as a PhD student in [Health and AI Lab](http://www.healthailab.org/) at 
[Stevens](https://www.stevens.edu/schaefer-school-engineering-science/departments/computer-science). 

My research interest focuses on: 
		
   1. causal inference, 
   2. decision making,
   3. learning from the data. 

I am also an affiliate of Algorithms, Law, and Policy working group under the umbrella of [Mechanism Design for Social Good (MD4SG)](https://www.md4sg.com/index.html) initiative.
