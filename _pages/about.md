**“You cannot take what you have not given, and you must give yourself. You cannot buy the Revolution. You cannot make the Revolution. 
You can only be the Revolution.”** 

**― Ursula K. Le Guin, The Dispossessed**

## About me

I received the B.S. degree in Electronics Engineering from Ankara University, 
Ankara, Turkey in 2011 and the M.S. degree in Biomedical Engineering from New 
Jersey Institute of Technology (NJIT), Newark, NJ in 2014. After overall 2.5 
years of research assistant experience in NJIT (Neural Prosthetics Lab) and 
NYU Langone Health (Neurosurgery Department), I joined the Center for Injury 
Biomechanics, Materials and Medicine as research associate on December 2014.

Previously, I performed research with Drs. Chandra and Skotak while working as a Research 
Associate at the [Center for Injury Biomechanics, Materials and Medicine] (https://centers.njit.edu/cibm3/) at NJIT. 
Research activities in the Center revolve around the investigation of the 
characteristics and the effects of blast waves on both animal and biomechanical 
models. This includes evaluation of biomechanical loading via pressure measurements, 
investigation of biochemical changes in the injured brains and computational work. 
The biggest part of my workload comprises analysis and interpretation of the 
experimental data, i.e. quantification of characteristics of various pressure-time
waveforms, including time-series analysis, evaluation of histological samples from 
high-resolution imaging of full coronal brain sections (e.g. silver stain and 
various immunohistochemical stains.

In August, I will be working with [Samantha Kleinberg] (http://www.skleinberg.org/) 
as a PhD student in [Health and AI Lab] (http://www.healthailab.org/) at 
[Stevens] (https://www.stevens.edu/schaefer-school-engineering-science/departments/computer-science). 

I am interested in research problems based on: 
		
   1) information extraction and integration from multiscale, multimodal health informatics, 
	 2) learning from the health data,
	 3)causal inference. 
			
My ultimate goal is to push the frontiers of knowledge in research areas such as 
personalized medicine, predictive diagnostics, and decision making by the power of 
artificial intelligence, machine learning and deep learning.
