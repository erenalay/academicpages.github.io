## Data-rich human communication

As a cognitive scientist and data scientist, I take a **data-rich approach** to
understanding **how people collaborate, bond, and fight**. To do that, I
weave together a **variety of data sources from the lab and the real world**
for a converging tapestry of the many ways in which our language, movement,
decisions, and emotions change during social contact. Understanding how context
---including conversational goals, social connections, and physical spaces---
shape our emerging behaviors is a primary goal of my research, embedded
within **rich traditions of dynamical and ecological perspectives** on human
behavior and cognition broadly.

I'm also interested in **developing methods** to quantify social interaction,
promoting **open science** research and education, and creating opportunities
for cognitive scientists and psychologists who are interested in **big data,
naturally occurring data, and data science**.

## About me

I received the B.S. degree in Electronics Engineering from Ankara University, 
Ankara, Turkey in 2011 and the M.S. degree in Biomedical Engineering from 
New Jersey Institute of Technology (NJIT), Newark, NJ in 2014. After overall 
2.5 years of research assistant experience in NJIT (Neural Prosthetics Lab) 
and NYU Langone Health (Neurosurgery Department), I joined the Center 
for Injury Biomechanics, Materials and Medicine as research associate on 
December 2014. 


I performed research with Drs. Chandra and Skotak while working as a Research 
Associate at the Center for Injury Biomechanics, Materials and Medicine at NJIT. 
Research activities in the center revolve around the investigation of the 
characteristics and the effects of blast waves on both animal and biomechanical models.
This includes evaluation of biomechanical loading via pressure measurements, 
investigation of biochemical changes in the injured brains and computational work. 
The biggest part of my workload comprises analysis and interpretation of the 
experimental data, i.e. quantification of characteristics of various pressure-time
waveforms, including time-series analysis, evaluation of histological samples from 
high-resolution imaging of full coronal brain sections (e.g. silver stain and 
various immunohistochemical stains.

I am interested in research problems based on: 
		
1) information extraction and integration from multiscale, multimodal health informatics, 
2) learning from the data,
3) causal inference. 
			
My ultimate goal is to push the frontiers of knowledge in research areas such 
as decision making, predictive diagnostics by the power of artificial intelligence 
and machine learning.

I'm currently in a transition to PhD. In August 2019, I will be working with 
[Samantha Kleinberg](http://www.skleinberg.org/) in [Health and AI Lab] 
(http://www.healthailab.org/) at [Stevens] 
(https://www.stevens.edu/schaefer-school-engineering-science/departments/computer-science).
